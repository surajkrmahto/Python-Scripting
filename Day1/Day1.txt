False               class               from                or

Comments
	ignore the statements to be executed

	single line comment    --> #
	multi line Comments    --> '''        '''


Data type
	the type of data which is stored
	
	primitive datatype
		it stores only one item or values in a storage
		each and everything is considered as an object

		integers		-->  <class 'int'>
		Boolean			--> bool
		Strings			--> str
		Decimals		--> float
		Complex numbers		--> complex


	Non primitive datatype
		it stores multiple value or item in a storage

		Data structures
			List
			Set
			Dictionary
			Tuple

Variable
	
	The value which changes in the run time
	python is dynamically typed   -->  it will read the values based on the context

Java			Python

int a =10;		a=10;	     --> Integer	--> int()
			st="Sunil"   -->  String
			fl= 3.142    --> float
			dec= True    --> Boolean
			com= 5+7j     --> complex

			val="234"   --> String
	
			type()


Identifier   --> the name of a variable 

		val=3.142

output statements
	Display the values or output on the console
	print()

;  -->  no need
case sensitive  --> functions, variables 

	C style print
	Formatted print
	Python print

python will save the file with .py extension


sal=10000  # integer 
exp=6.5 # float
comp="wipro" # String

print(type(sal))
print(type(exp))
print(type(comp))

print("My name is sunil")


#C style

print("sunil is working in %s from past %.2f years with salary %d"%(comp,exp,sal))

# Formatted style
print(f"sunil is working in {comp} from past {exp} years with salary {sal}")
print("sunil is working in {0} from past {1} years with salary {2}".format(comp,exp,sal))

#Unformatted or Python style
print("sunil is working in",comp," from past ",exp," years with salary ",sal)
#print("sunil is with sal"+sal)
#print("sunil is with experience"+exp)
#print("sunil is with company "+comp)
	

#print("sunil is with sal"+sal)----> this will give error that string can't concatenate with int or float
